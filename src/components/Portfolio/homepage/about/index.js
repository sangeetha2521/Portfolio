            <br></br> Passionate, creative, and driven, I'm Sangeetha, a full-stack software engineer from India. With
            one year of experience, I bring a blend of design and technology to create exceptional software products.{" "}
            <br></br>
            <br></br>My expertise lies in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a focus on React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and
            Express.js. I possess a deep understanding of these frameworks and leverage them to craft visually appealing
            and user-friendly applications. <br></br>
            <br></br>Beyond coding, I love exploring diverse interests. Whether it's watching YouTube videos, immersing
            myself in movies, or enjoying gaming sessions with friends, I believe in embracing life outside of work.
            Fueling my curiosity, I actively engage in side projects and contribute to open-source software. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            These endeavors push me to learn new technologies and continuously enhance my skillset. I'm excited to
            collaborate with like-minded individuals and teams on innovative projects.<br></br> <br></br>If you're
            seeking a dedicated and creative software engineer, let's connect and create something extraordinary
            together.
